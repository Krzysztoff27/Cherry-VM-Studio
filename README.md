# Cherry VM Studio
Cherry VM Studio is an open-source project designed with an aim to facilitate the process of creating and managing virtual machine learning environments.

In recent years more and more educational tools and knowledge platforms, essential for computer engineering enthusiasts have been shifting towards paid, especially subscription based, usage plans which most commonly are unaffordable for students.
 
Our mission is to allow people to leverage the power of open-source and create their own, independent, virtual learning environments for studying subjects like cybersecurity, operating systems administration, networking or computer science in general. In this way we can contribute to education by making it more accessible.

To achieve that, we created a platform which role is to facilitate the process of virtual machines management and remote access. In addition, we designed a system that allows for creating exercises, tasks and tests with automated assessment which could be particularly useful in academic environments.
